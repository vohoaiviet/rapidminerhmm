        <name>HMM Learner</name>
        <synopsis>Learns structure of HMM from the data. Input to the learning process
        are data that maps sequence of hidden states to sequence of observations. In case
        that this mapping is unknown and user knows only a number of states and has
        the sequence of observations then Baum-Welch or EM algorithms are applicable.</synopsis>
