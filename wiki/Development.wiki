#How to build and extend the RapidMiner HMM plugin.

= How to build the project from sources =

  # checkout RapidMiner (RM) source code via SVN from https://yale.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/yale
  # checkout source code of this project
  # change rm.dir property in `trunk/HMM/Vega/build.xml` file so it points to the dir with latest RM sources, in my case it is `<property name="rm.dir" location="../../../Vega" />`
  # build the plugin by executing `ant` command in `trunk/HMM/Vega/` directory
